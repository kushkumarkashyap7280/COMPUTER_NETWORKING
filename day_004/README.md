```mermaid
graph TD
    CE1[Customer Edge 1] --- PE1[Provider Edge 1]
    CE2[Customer Edge 2] --- PE2[Provider Edge 2]
    CE3[Customer Edge 3] --- PE3[Provider Edge 3]
    
    PE1 --- P1[Provider Core 1]
    PE1 --- P2[Provider Core 2]
    PE2 --- P2
    PE2 --- P3[Provider Core 3]
    PE3 --- P3
    PE3 --- P1
    
    subgraph "MPLS Network"
    PE1
    PE2

## 5. WAN Connectivity Protocols

### Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

PPP is a data link protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes.

**PPP Components:**
- LCP (Link Control Protocol)
- NCP (Network Control Protocol)
- Authentication protocols (PAP, CHAP)

**PPP Frame Format:**
```
+------+------+------+-------------+------+
| Flag | Addr | Ctrl |    Data     | FCS  |
+------+------+------+-------------+------+
```

### PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)

PPPoE combines Ethernet and PPP to provide authentication, encryption, and compression for Ethernet connections.

**PPPoE Process:**
1. Discovery stage (finds PPPoE server)
2. Session stage (establishes PPP session)

```mermaid

    Note over Client,Server: PPP Session Established

    Note over Client,Server: Data Transfer
    Client->>Server: PADT (PPPoE Active Discovery Termination)
```

## 6. WAN Design Considerations

### Bandwidth Requirements

Calculate bandwidth needs based on:
- Number of users
- Application requirements
- Growth projections
- Peak usage patterns

**Bandwidth Calculation Example:**
```
Total bandwidth = (Number of users Ã— Average usage per user) + Overhead
```

### Redundancy and Failover

Implement redundancy to ensure business continuity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Headquarters] --- B[Primary WAN Link]
    A --- C[Backup WAN Link]
    B --- D[Branch Office]
    C --- D
```

**Redundancy Techniques:**
- Dual WAN connections
- Diverse routing paths
- Different service providers
- Automatic failover

### Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS techniques prioritize critical traffic:

**QoS Mechanisms:**
- Classification and marking
- Congestion management (queuing)
- Congestion avoidance
- Traffic policing and shaping
- Link efficiency mechanisms

**Traffic Classification:**
```
Voice > Video > Critical data > General data > Background
```

## 7. WAN Security

### Secure VPN Technologies

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) create secure connections over public networks.

**VPN Types:**
- Site-to-Site VPNs
- Remote Access VPNs

```mermaid

    A[Branch Office] --- V[VPN Tunnel] --- B[Headquarters]
    C[Remote User] --- V
    
    subgraph "Public Internet"
    V
    end
```

**VPN Protocols:**
- IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)
- SSL/TLS VPN
