## Physical Layer Devices

Physical layer devices operate at Layer 1 of the OSI model and work with electrical or optical signals.

### Repeaters

A repeater is a network device that amplifies or regenerates digital signals received on an incoming cable before retransmitting them to another segment of cable.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Repeater Operation"
        A[Weakened Signal] --> B[Repeater]
        B --> C[Regenerated Signal]
    end
```

#### Key Characteristics of Repeaters

- **Function**: Extend the physical reach of a network by amplifying signals
- **OSI Layer**: Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- **Signal Processing**: Regenerates and retimes electrical signals
- **Collision Domains**: Does not create separate collision domains
- **Broadcast Domains**: Does not create separate broadcast domains
- **Intelligence**: No data examination or filtering
- **Ports**: Typically has 2 ports (input and output)

#### Applications of Repeaters

- Long-distance cable runs exceeding standard limitations
- Underground or underwater cable installations
- Overcoming signal degradation in harsh environments
- Legacy network systems with coaxial cabling

#### Limitations of Repeaters

- Cannot filter traffic (all signals are amplified)
- Does not isolate network segments from collisions
- Limited number of repeaters can be used in sequence due to timing issues
- No protocol conversion capabilities

### Hubs

A hub is a central connection point for devices in a network, typically in a star topology.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Hub Operation"
        H[Hub] --- D1[Device 1]
        H --- D2[Device 2]
        H --- D3[Device 3]
        H --- D4[Device 4]
    end
    
    subgraph "Signal Flow"
        D1 -- "Send data" --> H
        H -- "Broadcast to all ports" --> D2
        H -- "Broadcast to all ports" --> D3
        H -- "Broadcast to all ports" --> D4
    end
```

#### Types of Hubs

1. **Passive Hubs**: Simple connection points with no signal amplification
2. **Active Hubs**: Regenerate and clean up signals before transmission
3. **Intelligent Hubs**: Include management features and sometimes switching capabilities

#### Key Characteristics of Hubs

    Note over Bridge: Initially empty MAC table
    DeviceA->>Bridge: Frame to BB:BB
    Note over Bridge: Learn AA:AA on Port 1
    Bridge->>DeviceB: Forward to all ports (flooding)
