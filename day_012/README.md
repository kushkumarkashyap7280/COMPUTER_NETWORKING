# Day 12: Virtualization Technologies

## Topics Covered
- Virtualization Technologies

## 1. Introduction to Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and network resources.

    F --> F1[Application encapsulation<br>Containerization]
```

## 2. Server Virtualization

Server virtualization enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, with each VM using a share of the server's resources.

### Hypervisor Types

```mermaid

    A[Hypervisor Types] --> B[Type 1: Bare Metal]
    A --> C[Type 2: Hosted]
    
    B --> B1[VMware ESXi]

    C --> C1[VMware Workstation/Fusion]
    C --> C2[Oracle VirtualBox]
    C --> C3[Parallels Desktop]
```

**Type 1 (Bare Metal) Hypervisors:**
- Run directly on the host's hardware
- More efficient and secure
- Better performance
- Used in enterprise environments

**Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisors:**
- Run on a conventional operating system
- Easier to set up and use
- Lower performance than Type 1
- Used for development, testing, and desktop virtualization

### Virtual Machine Components

### Advanced Virtualization Features

**Live Migration:**
The process of moving a running virtual machine from one physical host to another without downtime.

```mermaid

    participant VM
    participant Destination Host
    
    Note over Source Host,Destination Host: VM running on Source Host
    Source Host->>Destination Host: Initialize migration
    Source Host->>Destination Host: Copy VM memory pages
    Note over Source Host,Destination Host: Iterative memory copying
    Source Host->>Destination Host: Final memory state
    Source Host->>Destination Host: Transfer VM control
    Note over Source Host,Destination Host: VM running on Destination Host
```

**Resource Pools:**
Logical abstraction that allows aggregation of compute resources for flexible allocation.

**VM Templates:**
Master copies of virtual machines used to create and provision new VMs.

**VM Snapshots:**
Point-in-time images of VM state, useful for backups and testing.

## 3. Network Virtualization

Network virtualization abstracts network resources from the underlying hardware, creating virtual networks that operate independently of the physical network.

### Virtual LANs (VLANs)

VLANs logically segment a single physical network into multiple isolated networks.

```mermaid

    D3 --- E
    D4 --- E
```

**NFV Benefits:**
