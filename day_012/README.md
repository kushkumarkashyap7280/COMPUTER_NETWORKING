## Introduction to Email Systems

Email (Electronic Mail) is one of the oldest and most widely used applications on the Internet. It allows users to send and receive messages containing text, images, and other attachments across computer networks. Despite being developed in the early 1970s, email remains a critical communication tool today.

### Key Characteristics of Email

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Sender and receiver don't need to be online simultaneously
- **Store-and-Forward Model**: Messages are stored on servers until delivery is possible
- **Platform Independence**: Works across different devices, operating systems, and applications
- **Structured Format**: Standard format for headers, body, and attachments
- **Globally Addressable**: Each recipient has a unique address (user@domain.com)
- **Resilient Delivery**: Multiple delivery attempts if initial delivery fails

### Brief History of Email

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1971 | Ray Tomlinson sends the first email between separate computers |
| 1972 | @ symbol chosen for separating user from host in email addresses |
| 1973 | SMTP's predecessor, FTP mail, is developed |
| 1977 | Standards for email format are proposed |
| 1982 | SMTP is defined in RFC 821 |
| 1988 | MIME extensions allow non-text attachments |
| 1991 | POP3 standardized for email retrieval |
| 1996 | IMAP4 finalized, offering more advanced mailbox management |
| 2000s | Webmail services become dominant |
| 2010s+ | Mobile email clients and anti-spam/security measures evolve |

## Email Architecture

Email systems are built on a distributed architecture with multiple components working together to ensure reliable message delivery.

#### Mail User Agent (MUA)
- The email client software used by end-users (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.)
- Responsible for composing, reading, and managing emails
- Communicates with mail servers using protocols like SMTP, POP3, or IMAP

#### Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
- Accepts emails from MUAs and performs initial processing
- Often integrated with the Mail Transfer Agent
- Applies outbound policies (size limits, spam checks, authentication)
- Typically runs on port 587 for secure submission

#### Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
- Routes emails between servers across the Internet
- Implements SMTP protocol for server-to-server communication
- Handles message queuing, retry logic, and routing decisions
- Examples: Postfix, Sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, Exim

#### Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
- Delivers messages to the recipient's mailbox
- Applies filters, sorts messages, and may perform virus scanning
- Often integrated with the MTA but conceptually separate
- Examples: Procmail, Dovecot LDA, Maildrop

#### Mail Retrieval Agents
- Allows users to access messages from their mailboxes
- Implements POP3 or IMAP protocols
- Often integrated with the mail server software

### Mail Server Types

| Server Type | Function | Common Software |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| SMTP Server | Sending and relaying messages | Postfix, Sendmail, Exchange |
| POP3 Server | Basic mailbox retrieval | Dovecot, Courier, Exchange |
| IMAP Server | Advanced mailbox management | Dovecot, Cyrus, Exchange |
| Webmail Server | Web-based email access | Roundcube, Squirrelmail, Gmail |
| Gateway Server | Email filtering, security | Barracuda, Proofpoint, Mimecast |

## SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for email transmission between servers on the Internet. It's defined in RFC 5321 and operates as a text-based, client-server protocol.

### SMTP Basics

- **Primary Purpose**: Reliable and efficient mail transfer
- **Port Numbers**: 25 (standard), 587 (submission), 465 (secure SMTP)
- **Connection Type**: Typically TCP-based
- **Communication Style**: Command-response exchanges in ASCII text
- **State Model**: Progression through multiple states (greeting, authentication, transaction, etc.)

### SMTP Communication Flow

### SMTP Extensions (ESMTP)

SMTP has been extended with ESMTP (Extended SMTP) capabilities to overcome limitations in the original protocol:

| Extension | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| SIZE | Message size declaration | Allows client to declare message size |
| 8BITMIME | 8-bit MIME transport | Enables transmission of 8-bit content without encoding |
| STARTTLS | Transport Layer Security | Allows upgrading connection to encrypted TLS |
| AUTH | Authentication | Provides mechanisms for client authentication |
| PIPELINING | Command pipelining | Allows sending multiple commands without waiting for responses |
| CHUNKING | Chunked transfer | Enables sending message in chunks |
| DSN | Delivery Status Notifications | Provides standardized delivery notifications |
| SMTPUTF8 | UTF-8 support | Allows UTF-8 characters in email addresses |

### Example SMTP Session (Raw)

```
S: 220 mail.example.com ESMTP Postfix
C: EHLO client.example.org
S: 250-mail.example.com
S: 250-PIPELINING
S: 250-SIZE 10240000
S: 250-STARTTLS
S: 250 8BITMIME
C: MAIL FROM:<sender@example.org>
S: 250 OK
C: RCPT TO:<recipient@example.com>
S: 250 OK
C: DATA
S: 354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
C: From: "Sender Name" <sender@example.org>
C: To: "Recipient Name" <recipient@example.com>
C: Subject: Hello World
C: Date: Thu, 2 Sep 2025 15:32:00 -0400
C: 
C: This is a test message.
C: .
S: 250 OK: queued as 12345
C: QUIT
S: 221 Bye
```

### SMTP Relay Operation

    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

SMTP servers can act as relays, accepting mail from one server and forwarding it to another. This is how email traverses multiple systems across the Internet:

1. **Direct Delivery**: If possible, sender's server delivers directly to recipient's server
2. **Smart Host Relay**: Small organizations often relay through ISP's SMTP server
3. **Mail Gateway Relay**: Messages may pass through security gateways or filters
4. **Geographic Relay**: Large organizations may use regional relay servers

### SMTP Port Usage

| Port | Usage | Security |
|------|-------|----------|
| 25 | Standard SMTP port for server-to-server communication | Typically unencrypted but can use STARTTLS |
| 587 | Mail submission port for clients sending to their servers | Typically uses STARTTLS for encryption |
| 465 | Secure SMTP port using implicit SSL/TLS | Encrypted from connection start |

### SMTP Limitations

1. **Limited to ASCII**: Originally only supported 7-bit ASCII characters
2. **No Delivery Confirmation**: Basic SMTP doesn't confirm message was read
3. **No Authentication**: Original SMTP had no built-in authentication
4. **No Encryption**: Base protocol sends data in clear text
5. **Susceptible to Abuse**: Can be exploited for spam and spoofing

## MX Records and DNS in Email Routing

MX (Mail Exchange) records are a type of DNS record that specifies which mail servers are responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain. They are crucial for proper email routing.

### MX Record Basics

- **Purpose**: Direct email to the correct mail servers for a domain
- **Priority**: Lower numerical preference value indicates higher priority
- **Redundancy**: Multiple MX records provide fallback options
- **Format**: Contains a preference value and a mail server hostname

### MX Record Lookup Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender as Sending Mail Server
    participant DNS as DNS System
    participant MX as MX Records
    participant Recipient as Receiving Mail Server
    
    Sender->>DNS: Query MX records for example.com
    DNS->>Sender: Returns MX records
    Note over Sender,DNS: MX 10 mail1.example.com<br>MX 20 mail2.example.com
    
    Sender->>DNS: Query A/AAAA for mail1.example.com
    DNS->>Sender: Returns IP address(es)
    Note over Sender,DNS: mail1.example.com = 192.0.2.1
    
    Sender->>Recipient: SMTP connection to 192.0.2.1
    
    alt If mail1.example.com is unreachable
        Sender->>DNS: Query A/AAAA for mail2.example.com
        DNS->>Sender: Returns IP address(es)
        Note over Sender,DNS: mail2.example.com = 192.0.2.2
        Sender->>Recipient: SMTP connection to 192.0.2.2
    end
```

### Example MX Record Configuration

```
example.com.    IN    MX    10    mail1.example.com.
example.com.    IN    MX    20    mail2.example.com.
example.com.    IN    MX    30    backup.example.com.
```

When sending an email to user@example.com, the sending mail server will:
1. Query DNS for MX records of example.com
2. Try to connect to the server with the lowest preference value (mail1.example.com)
3. If that fails, try the next server in order of preference

### Example MX Records Lookup (nslookup)

As shown in your command examples:

```bash
$ nslookup -type=MX google.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
google.com      mail exchanger = 10 smtp.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
smtp.google.com internet address = 142.251.10.26
smtp.google.com has AAAA address 2404:6800:4003:c0f::1a
smtp.google.com internet address = 64.233.170.26
smtp.google.com internet address = 142.251.12.27
smtp.google.com has AAAA address 2404:6800:4003:c1a::1a
smtp.google.com internet address = 64.233.170.27
smtp.google.com has AAAA address 2404:6800:4003:c11::1b
smtp.google.com internet address = 142.251.12.26
smtp.google.com has AAAA address 2404:6800:4003:c11::1a
```

```bash
$ nslookup -type=MX gmail.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com       mail exchanger = 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```

In the gmail.com example, we can see:
- Multiple MX records with different priorities (5, 10, 20, 30, 40)
- Primary mail server (gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com) has the lowest preference value (5)
- Four backup mail servers in priority order

### Other DNS Records Important for Email

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| A/AAAA | Maps hostnames to IP addresses | `mail.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1` |
| PTR | Reverse mapping (IP to hostname) | `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR mail.example.com.` |
| SPF | Specifies authorized sending servers | `example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a ip4:192.0.2.0/24 -all"` |
| DKIM | Email authentication for signatures | `selector._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0..."` |
| DMARC | Domain-based message authentication | `_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"` |

### Best Practices for MX Records

1. **Multiple MX Records**: Configure at least two MX records for redundancy
2. **Proper Prioritization**: Use appropriate preference values (lower = higher priority)
3. **Valid Hostnames**: Ensure MX records point to valid A/AAAA records
4. **Avoid Loops**: Don't create circular references between domains
5. **Consistent TTL Values**: Set appropriate Time-To-Live values for caching
6. **Consider Geographic Distribution**: For global organizations, distribute servers geographically
7. **No CNAME Records**: MX records should not point to CNAME records (RFC compliance)

## POP3: Post Office Protocol

POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is a protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It's designed for a "download and delete" model where messages are typically removed from the server after retrieval.

### POP3 Basics

- **Primary Purpose**: Download emails from server to client
- **Port Number**: 110 (standard), 995 (secure POP3S)
- **Connection Type**: TCP-based
- **State Model**: Authorization, Transaction, Update
- **Session Model**: Connect, retrieve, disconnect

### POP3 Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as POP3 Client
    participant Server as POP3 Server
    
    Client->>Server: Connect to port 110
    Server->>Client: +OK POP3 server ready
    
    Note over Client,Server: Authorization State
    Client->>Server: USER alice@example.com
    Server->>Client: +OK
    Client->>Server: PASS password123
    Server->>Client: +OK user successfully logged on
    
    Note over Client,Server: Transaction State
    Client->>Server: STAT
    Server->>Client: +OK 3 9876
    Client->>Server: LIST
    Server->>Client: +OK 3 messages
    Server->>Client: 1 2345
    Server->>Client: 2 3456
    Server->>Client: 3 4075
    Server->>Client: .
    
    Client->>Server: RETR 1
    Server->>Client: +OK 2345 octets
    Server->>Client: [Email content...]
    Server->>Client: .
    
    Client->>Server: DELE 1
    Server->>Client: +OK message 1 deleted
    
    Client->>Server: QUIT
    Server->>Client: +OK POP3 server signing off
    
    Note over Client,Server: Server enters Update state and removes deleted messages
```

### POP3 Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| USER | Specifies username | `USER alice@example.com` |
| PASS | Provides password | `PASS secretpassword` |
| STAT | Gets mailbox status | `STAT` |
| LIST | Lists message numbers and sizes | `LIST` or `LIST 1` |
| RETR | Retrieves a message | `RETR 1` |
| DELE | Marks message for deletion | `DELE 1` |
| NOOP | No operation | `NOOP` |
| RSET | Resets session (undeletes) | `RSET` |
| TOP | Gets headers and some lines | `TOP 1 10` |
| UIDL | Gets unique message IDs | `UIDL` or `UIDL 1` |
| QUIT | Ends session | `QUIT` |

### Example POP3 Session

```
C: [Connects to port 110]
S: +OK POP3 server ready
C: USER bob@example.com
S: +OK
C: PASS mysecretpassword
S: +OK Logged in.
C: STAT
S: +OK 2 320
C: LIST
S: +OK 2 messages
S: 1 120
S: 2 200
S: .
C: RETR 1
S: +OK 120 octets
S: From: alice@example.org
S: To: bob@example.com
S: Subject: Hello
S: Date: Thu, 2 Sep 2025 14:00:00 -0400
S: 
S: Hi Bob,
S: This is a test message.
S: Regards,
S: Alice
S: .
C: DELE 1
S: +OK Message deleted
C: QUIT
S: +OK Bye
```

### POP3 Characteristics

#### Advantages
- Simple protocol, easy to implement
- Minimal server resource usage
- Works well with intermittent connections
- Complete download allows offline access
- Clear mailbox state management

#### Limitations
- Limited mailbox management capabilities
- Typically "download and delete" model
- No server-side message organization
- No partial message retrieval
- No synchronization between multiple clients
- Limited metadata support

### POP3 Usage Modes

1. **Download and Delete**: Traditional mode where messages are removed after download
2. **Download and Keep**: Messages remain on server after download
3. **Download Headers Only**: Using TOP command to preview messages before full download

## IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a more advanced email retrieval protocol that allows users to manage their messages directly on the mail server. It's designed for multi-device access and synchronization.

### IMAP Basics

- **Primary Purpose**: Remote mailbox management
- **Port Number**: 143 (standard), 993 (secure IMAPS)
- **Connection Type**: TCP-based
- **State Model**: Non-authenticated, Authenticated, Selected, Logout
- **Session Model**: Connect, manage, disconnect (persistent connection)

| Flags/States | Tracks message states | Limited state tracking |
| Connection | Continuous connection typical | Connect, download, disconnect |
| Bandwidth Usage | Efficient (retrieves only needed parts) | Downloads entire messages |
| Server Resources | Higher requirements | Lower requirements |
| Offline Access | Limited without special features | Complete once downloaded |
| Complexity | More complex | Simpler |

## MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard that extends the format of email to support:
- Text in character sets other than ASCII
- Non-text attachments (images, audio, video, etc.)
- Message bodies with multiple parts
- Header information in non-ASCII character sets

### MIME Basics

- **Purpose**: Extend email beyond plain 7-bit ASCII text
- **RFC Standards**: 2045-2049, later expanded
- **Implementation**: Through email headers and body formatting
- **Content Description**: MIME-Version and Content-* headers
- **Encoding Methods**: Base64, Quoted-Printable, etc.

### MIME Headers

| Header | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| MIME-Version | Declares MIME standard use | `MIME-Version: 1.0` |
| Content-Type | Specifies media type | `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` |
| Content-Transfer-Encoding | Encoding method | `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64` |
| Content-Disposition | How to present content | `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.pdf"` |
| Content-ID | Identifier for content part | `Content-ID: <image1@example.com>` |

### Common MIME Media Types

| Category | MIME Type | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Text | text/plain | Plain text |
| Text | text/html | HTML-formatted text |
| Image | image/jpeg | JPEG image |
| Image | image/png | PNG image |
| Audio | audio/mpeg | MP3 audio |
| Video | video/mp4 | MP4 video |
| Application | application/pdf | PDF document |
| Application | application/json | JSON data |
| Application | application/zip | ZIP archive |
| Multipart | multipart/mixed | Multiple parts with different types |
| Multipart | multipart/alternative | Same content in different formats |
| Multipart | multipart/related | Related parts (e.g., HTML with images) |
| Multipart | multipart/form-data | Form data submission |

### MIME Encoding Methods

To ensure reliable transmission over systems that might only support 7-bit ASCII, MIME provides several encoding methods:

| Encoding | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 7bit | ASCII data with lines < 1000 chars | Plain English text |
| 8bit | 8-bit data with lines < 1000 chars | European language text |
| binary | 8-bit data without line length restrictions | Not widely supported in email |
| quoted-printable | Encodes with printable ASCII | Text with occasional non-ASCII |
| base64 | Binary data encoded as ASCII text | Binary files, images, etc. |

### Multipart MIME Example

```
MIME-Version: 1.0
From: sender@example.org
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Multipart message example
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="boundary-string"

--boundary-string
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Hello,
This is a sample message with attachments.
The snowman symbol: ☃ is encoded in quoted-printable.

--boundary-string
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

<html>
<body>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is a sample message with <b>attachments</b>.</p>
<p>The snowman symbol: ☃ is encoded in quoted-printable.</p>
</body>
</html>

--boundary-string
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="document.pdf"

--boundary-string--
```

### MIME and Email Clients

Modern email clients handle MIME transparently:
1. **Composition**: When adding attachments, the client constructs a multipart MIME message
2. **Encoding**: Binary files are automatically encoded (typically base64)
3. **Display**: When receiving, MIME parts are interpreted and rendered appropriately
4. **Attachments**: Identified via Content-Disposition headers and made available to save

## Email Security and Authentication

Email was originally designed without strong security measures. Modern extensions provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.

### Email Security Challenges

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Email Security Challenges] --> B[Spoofing]
    A --> C[Phishing]
    A --> D[Spam]
    A --> E[Malware]
    A --> F[Eavesdropping]
    A --> G[Man-in-the-Middle]
    A --> H[Data Leakage]
```

1. **Spoofing**: Forging the sender's address to appear as someone else
2. **Lack of Authentication**: Original SMTP doesn't verify sender identity
3. **Plaintext Transmission**: Emails can be intercepted and read
4. **No Integrity Protection**: Messages can be modified in transit
5. **Attachment Risks**: Malware can be distributed via attachments
6. **Header Exposure**: Metadata reveals communication patterns

### Email Authentication Standards

#### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF allows domain owners to specify which servers are authorized to send email on behalf of their domain.

```
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a ip4:192.0.2.0/24 -all"
```

- **Mechanism**: DNS TXT record
- **Verification**: Receiving server checks if sending IP is authorized
- **Limitation**: Only checks MAIL FROM domain, not From: header
- **Result Options**: Pass, Fail, SoftFail, Neutral, None, PermError, TempError

#### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a digital signature to emails that can be validated against a public key published in DNS.

```
selector._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC..."
```

- **Mechanism**: Cryptographic signing of headers and body
- **Verification**: Signature verified using public key from DNS
- **Advantage**: Detects message tampering and confirms sender domain
- **Components**: Signature in header, public key in DNS

#### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide domain-level policy enforcement and reporting.

```
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com"
```

- **Mechanism**: DNS TXT record with policy instructions
- **Function**: Tells receivers what to do with messages that fail authentication
- **Policy Options**: none (monitor), quarantine (mark as suspicious), reject (block)
- **Reporting**: Aggregate and forensic feedback to domain owners

### Email Encryption Methods

#### Transport Layer Encryption

- **STARTTLS**: Opportunistic encryption for SMTP connections
- **SSL/TLS**: Implicit encryption on dedicated ports (465, 993, 995)
- **Protection Level**: Encrypts server-to-server transmission
- **Limitation**: Only protects during transit, not storage

#### End-to-End Encryption

- **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)**
  - Uses X.509 certificates for encryption and signing
  - Widely supported in enterprise email clients
  - Requires certificate management infrastructure

- **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) / OpenPGP**
  - Public key cryptography for encryption and signing
  - Web of trust model rather than centralized certificates
  - Available as plugins for many email clients

- **End-to-End Advantages**
  - Messages encrypted on sender's device, decrypted on recipient's
  - Protected during transmission AND storage
  - Cannot be read by intermediary servers or providers

### Email Gateway Security

Enterprise email security often employs gateway solutions:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Anti-Spam | Filters unwanted bulk messages |
| Anti-Virus | Scans for malware in messages and attachments |
| Anti-Phishing | Detects fraudulent messages |
| Content Filtering | Blocks inappropriate content |
| Data Loss Prevention | Prevents sensitive information leakage |
| Encryption Gateway | Enforces encryption policies |
| Archiving | Preserves messages for compliance |

### SMTP Over TLS Example

    Server->>Client: 250-mail.example.com
    Server->>Client: 250-STARTTLS
    Server->>Client: 250 AUTH LOGIN PLAIN
    
    Client->>Server: STARTTLS
    Server->>Client: 220 Ready to start TLS
    
    Note over Client,Server: TLS Handshake
    
    Client->>Server: EHLO client.example.org

    Client->>Server: cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=
    Server->>Client: 235 Authentication successful
    
    Note over Client,Server: Continue with SMTP transaction (now encrypted)
```

## Email Workflow: End-to-End Example

Let's trace a complete email journey from sender to recipient:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender as Alice@example.org
    participant SenderMUA as Mail Client
    participant SenderMSA as Outgoing Server
    participant DNS as DNS System
    participant RecipientMTA as Mail Server
    participant RecipientMDA as Delivery Agent
    participant RecipientMUA as Bob's Mail Client
    participant Recipient as Bob@example.com
    
    Sender->>SenderMUA: Composes email
    SenderMUA->>SenderMSA: Submit via SMTP (port 587)
    Note over SenderMUA,SenderMSA: Authentication & TLS
    
    SenderMSA->>DNS: Query MX for example.com
    DNS->>SenderMSA: MX records
    SenderMSA->>DNS: Query A for mx.example.com
    DNS->>SenderMSA: IP address
    
    SenderMSA->>RecipientMTA: Connect via SMTP (port 25)
    Note over SenderMSA,RecipientMTA: MAIL FROM:<alice@example.org>
    Note over SenderMSA,RecipientMTA: RCPT TO:<bob@example.com>
    
    RecipientMTA->>DNS: SPF check for example.org
    DNS->>RecipientMTA: SPF record
    RecipientMTA->>DNS: DKIM check
    DNS->>RecipientMTA: DKIM public key
    
    RecipientMTA->>RecipientMDA: Pass message for delivery
    RecipientMDA->>RecipientMUA: Available via IMAP/POP3
    
    Recipient->>RecipientMUA: Checks email
    RecipientMUA->>RecipientMTA: IMAP connection
    RecipientMTA->>RecipientMUA: Email content
    RecipientMUA->>Recipient: Displays message
```

### Stage 1: Message Composition and Submission

1. **Composition**: User composes message in MUA (Mail User Agent/client)
   - Headers are created (From, To, Subject, Date, etc.)
   - Body is formatted (plain text, HTML, or both)
   - Attachments are encoded (Base64) and added as MIME parts

2. **Submission**: MUA connects to MSA (Mail Submission Agent)
   - Typically connects to port 587 with STARTTLS
   - Authenticates with username/password
   - Submits message using SMTP commands

### Stage 2: Mail Routing and Delivery

3. **DNS Lookup**: MSA/MTA looks up recipient domain's MX records
   - Determines which mail servers accept email for the domain
   - Resolves MX hostname to IP address

4. **SMTP Transfer**: Sending MTA connects to receiving MTA
   - Establishes SMTP connection to highest priority MX server
   - Initiates SMTP session (EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA)
   - Transfers the complete message

5. **Authentication Checks**: Receiving MTA verifies message authenticity
   - Checks SPF record to verify sending IP is authorized
   - Verifies DKIM signature if present
   - Applies DMARC policy based on authentication results
   - Performs spam filtering and malware scanning

6. **Local Delivery**: MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) processes the message
   - Applies user-specific filters or rules
   - Stores message in recipient's mailbox
   - Might send notifications to recipient

### Stage 3: Message Retrieval

7. **Retrieval**: Recipient accesses the message
   - Via POP3: Downloads messages to local client
   - Via IMAP: Views and manages messages on server
   - Via Webmail: Accesses through web interface

8. **Display**: MUA renders the message
   - Interprets MIME structure
   - Renders HTML content if present
   - Shows attachments
   - Verifies signatures if using S/MIME or PGP

2. Compare and contrast POP3 and IMAP protocols. Why might an organization prefer one over the other for their email system?

3. Draw and explain the complete path of an email from sender to recipient, including all major components and protocols involved.

4. How do SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work together to prevent email spoofing and phishing? Provide examples of DNS records for each.

5. Explain the structure of a MIME multipart email with an HTML body and a PDF attachment. Include sample headers and boundary markers.

6. What challenges did the original SMTP protocol have regarding security, and how have modern extensions addressed these issues?

7. Describe the authentication process when a user sends an email through a modern mail server. What security measures are typically in place?

8. What is the significance of the STARTTLS command in SMTP? How does it differ from using a dedicated secure port like 465?

9. You're setting up an email server for a small business. What DNS records should you configure to ensure reliable email delivery and minimize the chance of your outgoing emails being marked as spam?

10. A user reports they can send emails but cannot receive any. Outline the troubleshooting steps you would take, including the specific components you would check.
